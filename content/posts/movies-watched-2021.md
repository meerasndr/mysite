## Movies I am watching in 2021
I ended 2020 by watching quite a few movies in December. I wanted to get into the habit of watching movies in 2021, especially ones that are outside my comfort zone. I would like to think of this as my attempt to "practice" film appreciation. My choice of films is a mix of recommendations from streaming services and film reviewers, and some classics, and sometimes even randomly on whim.

This post basically is a record of the movies I watch in 2021, maybe with some notes. I regularly re-watch some movies like Edhir Neechal (1968), Mozhi, Taare Zameen Par, Thillu Mullu. I have not included these here.

1. Soul (Pixar, English, 2020)
2. Kiki's delivery service (Studio Ghibli, 1989)
3. Maara (Tamizh, Madhavan / Shraddha Srinath, 2021)
4. Chef (English, Jon Favreau, 2014)
5. E.T. the Extra Terrestrial (English, Steven Spielberg, 1982)
6. Princess Mononoke (Studio Ghibli, 1997)
7. Aandavan Kattalai (Tamizh, Vijay Sethupathi, 2016)
8. Sir (Hindi, Tilottama Shome, 2018)
9. City Lights(Silent, Charlie Chaplin, 1931)
10. Tenet (English, Christopher Nolan, 2020)
