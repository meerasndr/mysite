## Movies I watched in 2021 (ongoing)
I ended Dec 2020 by watching quite a few movies. I wanted to get into the habit of watching movies in 2021, especially ones that are outside my comfort zone. I would like to think of this as my attempt to "practice" film appreciation. My choice of films is a mix of recommendations from streaming services and film reviewers, and some classics, and sometimes even randomly on whim.

This post basically is a record of the movies I watch in 2021, maybe with some notes.

#### January:
1. Soul (Pixar, English, 2020)
2. Kiki's delivery service (anime)
3. Maara (Tamizh, 2021, Madhavan / Shraddha Srinath)
4. The Chef (English, Jon Favreau)
5. E.T. the Extra Terrestrial (English)
6. Princess Mononoke (anime)
7. Aandavan Kattalai (Tamizh, Vijay Sethupathi)
8. Sir (Hindi, Tilottama Shome)
