      <description>I presented my first public tech-talk last week at Wroc TypeScript. Due to the pandemic situation worldwide, most meetups have become virtual. So, I had the opportunity to present at a Poland-based meetup, from India!
The title of my talk was: Cross-browser testing and automation with Puppeteer and TypeScript. It was a code-walkthrough of sorts. The mini(some even micro)-projects I presented were:
 Hello Puppeteer : Screenshot &amp;amp; Image blocking demo Testing DOM elements using Jest + Puppeteer Tracking DOM value changes + GraphQL event notification (homegrown discount notification service!</description>

Another low-hanging fruit is a setup to control Arduino LEDs from the browser, through a HTML page with buttons. That is what this post is about. I&amp;rsquo;ll split this post into three parts:</description>
